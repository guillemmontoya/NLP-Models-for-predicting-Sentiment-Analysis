# About the Project
In this project we use the "Large Movie Review Dataset", This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing.

We use various NLP models to train and classify the reviews into positive or negative and verify which one is giving the best results.
In the notebook you will see the analysis of the following models:
- FastText Embeddings + CNN
- FastText Embeddings + LSTM
- NNLM Universal Embedding Model
- LLM Transformer: DistilBert
