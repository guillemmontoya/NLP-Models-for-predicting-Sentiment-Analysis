# Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to apply various NLP techniques and to see which ones give the best results when predicting Semtiment Analysis of various movie reviews

# Methods Used
We use various NLP models to train and classify the reviews into positive or negative and verify which one is giving the best results.
In the notebook you will see the analysis of the following models:
- FastText Embeddings + CNN
- FastText Embeddings + LSTM
- NNLM Universal Embedding Model
- LLM Transformer: DistilBert

# Technologies
Python
Keras Tensorflow
DistilBert Transformer

# Project Description
In this project we use the "Large Movie Review Dataset", that is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. We will be using various NLP models to predict wether a review is positive or negative and checking what model gives the best performance towards the test data
